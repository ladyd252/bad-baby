This is my first post!!&nbsp;

Wooooo!!!

Yeyyyy!!

Ok, got that out of my system.

Honestly though, it took me a &nbsp;while to make something I felt was worthy of a first post. I think I've found it! And, not only is it something I feel is worthy of a post, I've been searching for this recipe for a long time - a truly chocolatey cake. I found that most chocolate cake recipes I followed didn't actually have a strong chocolate flavor; and when I tried to pack them in with more chocolate, the texture or moistness of the cake would suffer. However, I think this cake maintains a great texture, moistness, AND flavor.

The initial inspiration for this cake comes from [Molly Yeh's chocolate cake recipe](http://mynameisyeh.com/mynameisyeh/2015/9/basil-mascarpone-buttercream-frosted-chocolate-cake-a-giveaway). I've made a few tweaks to get the flavor just the way I like it, and also experimented with a cocoa powder. I was researching the different types of cocoa and found a recipe that recommended this particular cocoa powder, which I also liked because it gave the cake a jet-black look. However, I don't think it's necessary to get a great flavor. You could replace the two powders (the special black and the natural Hershey's) with Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa, which is a blend of natural and dutch processed cocoa and should achieve similar results.&nbsp;
