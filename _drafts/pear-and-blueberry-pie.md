    Crust


    * 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

    * 1 teaspoon salt

    * 1 teaspoon sugar

    * 1 cup (2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into small pieces

    * 1 tsp sugar, to sprinkle on top


    Filling


    * 8 ripe pears, cut into 1in cubes

    * 2 cups blueberry ( I used frozen. I measured them out while frozen but let
    them thaw before using)

    * 1/2 tbsp cinnamon

    * 1/2 tbsp vanilla

    * 1/2 cup brown sugar

    For the crust:


    1. Using a pastry cutter, or a food processor, cut together flour, salt,
    sugar.&nbsp;

    2. Add butter and cut together until most of the butter is mixed in to
    create a coarse mixture, with some pea sized chunks left.

    3. Add 1/4 cup ice water and mix until crumbly but can hold together when
    shaped. If necessary, add up to 4 tbsp more water, 1 tbsp at a time.&nbsp;

    4. Turn dough out on to work area and knead lightly.

    5. Divide and shape into two disks, cover in saran wrap, and refrigerate for
    at least one hour or up to three days.


    Assembling the pie


    1. Pre heat oven to 400F

    2. Roll out one pie dough disk and transfer to a 9in pie pan.

    3. Brush crust with egg white.

    4. Pre bake pie crust for 8-10 minutes.

    5. Toss filling ingredients together.

    6. After crust finished prebaking, take out and let cool a bit.

    7. Meanwhile, take out other pie dough disk and roll out. Leave as is, cut
    into a lattice or any shape you desire.

    8. Pour filling into crust. It should be just slightly higher than the sides
    of the pie dish.

    9. Cover with rest of dough. If you left it as one round sheet, make sure to
    cut slits or a shape into the center so the steam can escape.

    10. Brush top with remaining egg white and sprinkle with sugar.

    11. Bake for 45 minutes at 400F or until pie catches color.

    12. Let the pie set for a few hours or preferably overnight, then enjoy!

So Pi Day came around a few weeks ago, and this blog post was conceived then. There's nothing&nbsp;**rational**&nbsp;about how gooooood this pie is! (See what I did there?!)

So I had been wanting to make something with pears since they're in season, and the blueberries offered a bit of pectin to help the pie come together, as well as a nice color.

&nbsp;

The ingredients ended up making a bit more than one pie dish, so I rummaged and found these little individual muffin tins which became mini pie tins for this adventure. They came out SO FRIGGIN CUTE. I think I'll have to do a follow up recipe dedicated to mini pies one day because I was so into them.

And now, without further ado, the recipe!
