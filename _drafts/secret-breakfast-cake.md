    1. Preheat oven to 350F. Spray two 8 inch cake pans with non stick spray and
    cover with parchment paper. Spray parchment paper as well.

    2. Add butter and sugar to a large bowl and beat with paddle attachment.
    Beat for 3-4 minutes on medium speed, until very fluffy, occasionally
    scraping down with a spatula.

    3. &nbsp;Turn mixer to low speed and add eggs, one at a time, scraping bowl
    in between.

    4. Add oil, then buttermilk and vanilla.

    5. Finally slowly add dry ingredients and mix until combined, but don't over
    mix.

    6. Pour half the batter into each pan and bake for 30-35 minutes, until a
    skewer comes out mostly clean/with a few crumbs.
