    **For cake**


    1. Preheat oven to 350F. Spray two 8 inch cake pans with non stick spray and
    cover with parchment paper. Spray parchment paper as well.

    2. Add butter and sugar to a large bowl and beat with paddle attachment.
    Beat for 3-4 minutes on medium speed, until very fluffy, occasionally
    scraping down with a spatula.

    3. &nbsp;Turn mixer to low speed and add eggs, one at a time, scraping bowl
    in between.

    4. Add oil, then buttermilk and vanilla.

    5. Finally slowly add dry ingredients and mix until combined, but don't over
    mix.

    6. Pour half the batter into each pan and bake for 30-35 minutes, until a
    skewer comes out mostly clean/with a few crumbs.

    7. Let the cake cool for 15-20 minutes in pans, then take out of pans to
    continue cooling until cooled completely.

    8. At this point, you can wrap the cake in plastic wrap and aluminum foil or
    place in a large freezer safe ziploc bag. You can freeze the cake until
    you're ready to fill and decorate, or just refrigerate if you'll be
    decorating the next day.


    **For candied cereal**


    1. Preheat oven to 350F and cover a large sheet pan with parchment
    paper.&nbsp;

    2. In a large bowl stir together cornflakes, egg whites, and sugar

    3. Pour mixture over sheet pan and lightly smooth to an even layer.

    4. Bake for 20 minutes, in the middle agitating and turning the mix around
    with a large spatula.

    5. Let the mixture cool down completely to crisp up. If there are large
    clumps, crush lightly with hands to break up.


    **For filling**


    1. Whisk cream, sugar, and egg yolks together in a sauce pan.

    2. Heat over medium high heat on stove, whisking very often. Make sure to
    get the bottom to avoid cooking egg.

    3. Heat until mixture begins bubbling, then continue whisking and cooking
    for an additional minute.&nbsp;

    4. Take off heat and let the mixture cool to room temperature, then chill in
    refrigerator for at least an hour.

    5. After the mixture has chilled, whisk in mascarpone until smooth.


    **Vanilla frosting**


    * Combine cream and instant pudding powder in mixer bowl. Whip until the
    cream forms stiff peaks.


    **Assembly**


    1. Brush cake layers with rum - you can adjust the amount to your liking\!

    2. Place one layer on cake circle or large plate. Pipe or use a spatula to
    smooth custard filling over the first layer. Then place second layer on top,

    3. Frost layers with vanilla frosting.

    4. Cover sides with candied cornflakes. For the top, you can also cover with
    cornflakes, or decorate with swirls of frosting.
