One of my favorite go to cake recipes is this [olive and summer fruit cake from Williams Sonoma.](https://blog.williams-sonoma.com/olive-oil-cake-with-summer-fruit-recipe/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}&nbsp;I came across this recipe a couple of years ago, and I've made it with many variations and sizes, such as little personal cakes blueberry olive oil cakes that are \*delicious\*. This cake has so much flavor, is so moist, and can be customized with whatever fruit you have on hand. You can pair it with a little whipped cream, yogurt, or mascarpone, or keep it simple with a dusting of powdered sugar... It's definitely now a staple in my toolbox. But what does that have to do with this recipe?
