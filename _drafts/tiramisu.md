    For the custard

    * 6 egg yolks
    * 3/4 cup sugar
    * 2/3 cup milk
    * 1 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
    * 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
    * 1 pound mascarpone OR ricotta cheese

    * 1\.5 cups strong coffee
    * 2-4 tbsp rum, to taste
    * a bar or a few squares of dark chocolate

    Note: I use a 9x13 pan to prepare this cake and make it 1 layer. If you'd
    like to make a taller cake (2 layers), split the lady fingers, custard, and
    whipped cream and layer them in a smaller pan, such as 7x11.


    1. Whisk together egg yolks, sugar, and milk in a saucepan.

    2. Cook mixture over medium heat while whisking constantly. Once mixture
    starts bubbling, cook for an additional minute. Then take off heat and allow
    to cool for a few minutes. \*

    3. Cover and refrigerate for at least an hour. In the mean time....

    4. Whip your cream and vanilla until soft peaks form.

    5. Mix your rum and coffee. Dip ladyfingers into the boozy coffee and then
    line your pan with the soaked ladyfingers.

    6. Once yolk mixture has cooled, lightly whisk with your cheese of choice
    (mascarpone or ricotta). Avoid over mixing.

    7. Layer custard on top of lady fingers, followed by whipped cream.

    8. Grate dark chocolate over entire top of cake.

    9. Cover and refrigerate for a few hours before serving.

    10. Enjoy :)&nbsp;


    \* Got too much graininess in your mixture? A little secret: you could give
    it a tiny blitz in the blender before whisking with the mascarpone or
    ricotta. The mix might be a little more liquid-y, especially if you're using
    ricotta which is much softer than mascarpone, so a little extra chill time
    might be required.

Tiramisu is my old faithful. While not too complicated, the delicious layers of boozed up coffee-ness and creamy custard are crowd pleasers. Its also the cake my mom usually requests I make for special events. A while back we went over to my parents house for Rosh Hashana, and this baby made an appearance. While not a traditional dessert for the Jewish New Year, its a traditional dessert for our family\!

It might be intimidating to make the custard cream by cooking egg yolks, but really once you get the hang of it (and honestly it's much easier than you think\!), you'll be amazed at the great power of deliciousness you now command. The key is to always be whisking, making sure nothing is sticking to the bottom or sides of the saucepan, &nbsp;and to not turn up the heat too high to avoid overcooking and getting clumps of egg.

After that, all thats left is the whipped cream and boozy coffee dipped ladyfingers - easy peasy\! In no time, you can be sitting around a table digging into a delightful tiramisu.
