  directions_markdown: >-
    1. Preheat oven to 350F

    2. Arrange 48 mini cupcake liners in a cupcake pan (or about 20 large ones)

    3. Crush graham crackers. This can be done many ways, but a food processor
    or powerful blender will make it a quick job.

    4. Add melted butter into graham crackers and mix until you get a "batter"
    that can hold together if pressed.

    5. Press crust batter into each liner. Easy way to do this is to scoop a
    rounded a teaspoon into each cup and press with a small cup/utensil to
    flatten.

    6. In a mixing bowl, using a whisk or whisking attachment on a mixer, whisk
    together sugar, cream cheese, and ricotta.

    7. Add salt, vanilla, and matcha powder.

    8. Add eggs, one by one, mixing throughly in between and scraping bowl.

    9. Pour batter into each cup - about 3/4 full.&nbsp;

    10. Bake for approximately 8-10 minutes until set for mini cupcakes, or 20
    min for regular size.

    11. Let cheesecakes cool completely, and refrigerate for a few hours before
    serving.

    12. To decorate - whip cream with sugar to soft peaks. pipe swirls on
    cheesecakes, and top with berries.

So this past weekend Mike and I had a bunch of friends over for a special event: Mike did a "mini concert" of Bob Dylan covers, and I made a whole bunch of mini desserts\! We called it "Dylan and Desserts", because alliteration.&nbsp;

One of said desserts was this mini matcha cheesecake. How cute is that???&nbsp;

Somehow everything seems cuter when its just a little bit smaller. It's also a perk that you can eat a few of them and not feel too guilty.

This recipe makes quite a few of these little ones. I also always get into quite a baking frenzy when I think there won't be enough food, and of course there was way too much, so I ended up taking a couple of boxes of assorted left over desserts to work. Rest assured, nobody was complaining.

One final note: you can also make these in regular cupcake size, and I think you could pretty easily cut the recipe in half if you wanted to make less.

Hope you enjoy these\!
