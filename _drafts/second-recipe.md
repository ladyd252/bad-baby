    * 1 1/2 cups cherries, pitted
    * 8 oz cream cheese
    * 2 tbsp butter
    * 1/4 cup and 1 tbsp sugar, separated
    * 1 tsp fresh chopped rosemary
    * 1/2 tbsp vanilla
    * 1/2 tbsp lemon juice
    * 1 package of 2 sheets of puff pastry, thawed (I used Pepperidge Farm, but any should do)
  directions_markdown: >-
    1. Preheat over to 400F

    2. Heat skillet on stove on medium heat. Add butter and let it melt. Add
    rosemary, cook for 30 seconds - minute, then add cherries. Sprinkle cherries
    with a tbsp of sugar and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally to
    prevent burning.&nbsp;

    3. Whisk together cream cheese, egg, 1/4 cup sugar, vanilla, and lemon juice
    until throughly combined. If you get some curdling, fear not - the cheese
    should be fine after baking.

    4. Roll out puff pastry and stack two sheets on top of a cookie sheet covered
    with parchment paper. Press the sheets lightly together.

    5. Spread cheese mixture on puff pastry, up until about an inch from the
    edge.

    6. Spread cherries evenly on top of cheese mixture.

    7. Bake for 25 minutes. Pastry should have puffed up and have a nice golden
    color.

    8. Enjoy!

Summer is upon us here in San Francisco, which means the weather is cloudy and dreary. However, fear not… It also means cherries are in season!![](/uploads/versions/dsc-0101---x----1504-1000x---.jpg)

For this dessert, I wanted to try something with these seasonal fruits and add in some cheesiness. The cheese in this tart reminds me of a type of danish my grandmother used to make us. She would put raisins in the middle as a little surprise which I loved. A year or so ago my sister recreated the recipe and it was like a walk down memory lane. Maybe I'll try it out in the coming weeks and share it as well! :)&nbsp;

Back to the fruit in this tart… Feel free to try this recipe out with different stone fruit. I think peaches, apricots, nectarines, or other stone fruit would do well in this recipe. The first version I tried of this recipe has a combination of apricots and cherries and was also delicious. Of course, a larger fruit would save you some time pitting!

Finally, the rosemary… while not required for this recipe, I think you'll find it makes for a beautiful addition to the flavor of the fruit, and a lovely fragrance in the kitchen.
