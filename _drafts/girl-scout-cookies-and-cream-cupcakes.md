I must admit, I'm not usually a fan of desserts composed of other desserts. But, girl scout cookie season came around, and I had the urge to crush them, mix them with frosting, and put them on a cupcake! That's a normal urge right??&nbsp;

Anywho, these use my favorite go to chocolate cake recipe: oil instead of butter to provide more moisture, and real melted dark chocolate as well as brewed coffee to bring out the chocolate flavor.

For the frosting, I take a basic Swiss meringue frosting recipe, then mix it with crushed cookies to get a cookies n' cream frosting. Since the chunks in the frosting make it quite difficult to pipe, I used a cookie dough scoop to get a nice half dome of frosting on top of the cupcakes. To make them look festive, I added a quarter cookie on top of each and drizzled with melted dark chocolate.&nbsp;

For my batch, I split the Swiss meringue frosting in half so I could do two different flavors - Thin Mint and Samoa! You can try different flavors, and even (gasp) non girl scout cookies should you run out.

So cheers - to having your cookie and cupcake and eating them too!
