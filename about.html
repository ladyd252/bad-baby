  <h1>About Dana Yakoobinsky</h1>
  <h3>
    Hello, and welcome to the Bad Baby Bakery Blog, a shrine to dessert and
    alliteration! But mostly dessert.
  </h3>
  <p>
    A little about me... I started baking in highschool to make sweet treats for my friends on their birthdays. In the beginning it was just an occasional fun thing to do. When I got to college, I made a friend who was also into baking and we would have regular cupcake baking sessions (we only accidentally lit something on fire once or twice). I started getting more and more into baking and experimenting with different flavors and techniques. Eventually, I graduated to other types of baked goodies - even though cupcakes will always hold a spot in my heart. Today, I work full time as a software engineer but seem to bake full time too... Unclear how that works out. Here, I share some of my experiments! Hope you enjoy these recipes, and if you have any questions, please feel free to message me through the contact form.

  <p>Best,&nbsp;
