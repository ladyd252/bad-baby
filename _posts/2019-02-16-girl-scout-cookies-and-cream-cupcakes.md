    For the cupcake:


    1. Preheat oven to 375F (or 350F for convection oven) and line a
    mini/regular cupcake baking sheet with cupcake liners.

    2. Whisk sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt
    together in a large bowl.

    3. In another bowl, mix together egg, oil, vanilla and milk.&nbsp;

    4. Whisk liquids into dry ingredients until mostly smooth.

    5. Whisk in melted chocolate and coffee.

    6. Fill cupcake liners with batter to \*\*\*no more than half, or a smidge
    less\*\*\*.&nbsp;

    7. For mini cupcakes, bake for 8-10minutes, until toothpick inserted into
    middle of cupcake comes out clean. For full size, bake 18-22 minutes and
    check with a toothpick as well.

    8. Let cool completely.


    For frosting:


    1. In a metal, heat proof bowl (I use the bowl of my stand mixer), whisk
    together sugar and egg whites.

    2. Make a double boiler by simmering water in a sauce pan and putting the
    metal bowl over the sauce pan.&nbsp;

    3. Whisk sugar and egg whites while heating to avoid cooking the egg whites,
    until the mixture reaches 150F.

    4. Take bowl off heat, and beat for 7-10 minutes, until you get stiff peaks.
    You should be able to flip the bowl over and the meringue doesn't move. The
    bowl should also not be hot by now. If it is still warm, put it in the
    fridge for 15-30 minutes.

    5. Being adding butter in small cubes into the meringue. Once one disappears
    go ahead and add the next. If mixture starts looking too liquid, put in
    fridge for 10 minutes.

    6. Add vanilla.

    7. Finally, when your frosting looks fluffy, add in your crushed/chopped
    cookies.

    8. Using a cookie dough scoop, scoop a&nbsp; half dome of frosting unto each
    little cupcake.


    For decorating:


    1. Using a fork, drizzle melted chocolate over top of frosting. Make sure
    chocolate isn't super hot but has had a few minutes to cool a bit to avoid
    melting frosting.

    2. Add a quarter/half cookie on top of cupcake for a final touch!

I must admit, I'm not usually a fan of desserts composed of other desserts. But, girl scout cookie season came around, and I had the urge to crush them, mix them with frosting, and put them on a cupcake! That's a normal urge right??

Anywho, these use my favorite go to chocolate cake recipe: oil instead of butter to provide more moisture, and real melted dark chocolate as well as brewed coffee to bring out the chocolate flavor.

For the frosting, I take a basic Swiss meringue frosting recipe, then mix it with crushed cookies to get a cookies n' cream frosting. Since the chunks in the frosting make it quite difficult to pipe, I used a cookie dough scoop to get a nice half dome of frosting on top of the cupcakes. To make them look festive, I added a quarter cookie on top of each and drizzled with melted dark chocolate.

For my batch, I split the Swiss meringue frosting in half so I could do two different flavors - Thin Mint and Samoa! You can try different flavors, and even (gasp) non girl scout cookies should you run out.

So cheers - to having your cookie and cupcake and eating them too!
