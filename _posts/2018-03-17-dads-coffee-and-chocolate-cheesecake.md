    3. In a small pot, bring the cream to a simmer, and add instant
    coffee/espresso powder. Let it cool a bit.

    4. Beat cream cheese, sour cream, sugar, and coffee cream until well
    combined, scraping the bowl periodically.&nbsp;

    5. Once the dairy and sugar is well mixed, add eggs one by one, scraping

    10. For the ganache topping, chop dark chocolate into small pieces, place in
    a heat save bowl.

    11. Bring cream to a simmer, and pour over the dark chocolate. Let it sit
    for a minute before stirring until all the chocolate has melted and mixed
    with the cream.

    12. Pour chocolate onto cake, and with the help of a spatula spread over the
    cake. Refrigerate cake until ganache has set, 30min - 1hr.

    favorite tip pipe over the ganache.&nbsp;

It's been a minute since my last post! Well, we're back today with a new recipe. It was my dad's birthday a week ago and I thought it was a good opportunity to make him something with two things he loves: coffee and chocolate!

This cheesecake has a delicate coffee flavor, punctuated by a chocolatey crust and a rich ganache topping. I think it looks pretty festive, and you can make it your own by doing different pipings, using whole or crushed cookies instead of chocolate covered coffee beans, drizzling ganache instead of spreading on top, etc.

My dad definitely enjoyed it, and I think you might too!
