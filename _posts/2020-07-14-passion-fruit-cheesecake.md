    1. Prepare cheesecake or springform pan by spraying with nonstick spray.
    This recipe is for 11 x 2.5 inch pan, but you can use a smaller diameter to
    make a taller cheesecake.

    2. Preheat oven to 325F.

    3. Crush graham crackers using a food processor, blender, or by hand.

    4. Add 4-5 tbsp butter, until cracker crumbs are a bit mushy.

    5. Press evenly into bottom of pan.

    6. Bake for 10 minutes.

    7. Meanwhile, beat cream cheese and ricotta until smooth.

    8. Add sugar and lemon zest, beat together.

    9. Add passion fruit puree.

    10. Finally, add eggs, one at a time, beating for 30 seconds after each
    addition. Make sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl in between to get
    through mixing.

    11. Pour filling onto crust.

    12. Bake for about an hour, until edges are set and center is still jiggly.

    13. Let cheesecake cool for a couple of hours on the counter top, then
    refrigerate for at least a few hours before serving, preferably overnight.


    **Decoration**


    1. Reserve a few tbsp of puree, then heat remaining puree as well as the
    pulp and seeds of one passion fruit in a small pot. You can give it a taste
    - if you prefer it a little sweeter, add 1-2 tbsp sugar.

    2. Mix the reserved puree with a tbsp of corn starch.&nbsp;

    3. When the puree in the pot starts bubbling, add the cornstarch mixture
    while whisking the heating puree. The whole mix should thicken in less than
    30 seconds. Remove from heat.

    4. Let the glaze cool for a few minutes, then pour over cheesecake.

    5. Pipe whipped cream and arrange fresh berries around cheesecake

    6. Grate dark chocolate over top.

I couldn't imagine our world would get any crazier last time I posted on here, and yet here we are in the midst of so much social/political unrest and (still) smack dab in the middle of a pandemic. I think the US is going through a really hard reckoning, but I hope that we can all grow through this. I hope we can all recognize that not everyone is treated equally here; that white supremacy is still a problem; that centuries of enslavement and systemic racism don't magically disappear; that most importantly, we find a way to create a more equal society. It feels a bit strange to talk about this here, on a personal baking blog, but it also feels wrong not to mention all that's going on right now.

On a personal level, while all this has been happening Mike and I decided to move out of our place, so thats partially why I haven't posted in a bit. We've finally settled in a bit where we're staying now, and I had a chance last weekend to try out a dessert I've had in mind for a while - passion fruit cheesecake.

I love passion fruit and passion fruit desserts, and this cheesecake did not disappoint. I paired it with a chocolatey crust and some chocolate flakes on top as well which worked out nicely. If you're wondering where to find passion fruit puree, I can usually find them in the freezer section of Mexican or South American grocers. Adding the pulp of a fresh fruit in the decoration is mostly for the look - the seeds help make the cake look the part of a passion fruit cheesecake, but they are expensive and can be harder to find (I found some in Whole Foods). Feel free to leave it out, and fear not - the cake will still be delicious. In fact, you can play around with the decoration to your liking: pour ganache over it for more chocolate, replace the chocolate flakes and fruit with some toasted coconut, use different fruit to decorate, etc.

Hope you enjoy this cake, stay safe, and stay kind.
