    **For cupcakes:**


    1. &nbsp;Preheat oven to 350F and line mini cupcake pan for 48 mini cupcakes
    (or about 20 regular cupcakes)

    2. In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar for 2-3 minutes, until fluffy

    3. Add eggs, one at a time. Scrape bowl in between.

    4. Add zest and vanilla.

    5. In a separate bowl mix together flour and baking powder.

    6. Add in flour mix and remaining liquids, in an alternating fashion (about
    1/3 of flour, than 1/3 of lemon juice and milk, etc)

    7. Pour/spoon batter into cupcake liners, filling to about 2/3 full.&nbsp;

    8. Bake mini cupcakes for about 8-10 minutes, testing that toothpick comes
    out clean.

    9. Cool completely


    **For Frosting:**


    1. In a medium bowl, mix together puree and condensed milk.

    2. Whip cream until stiff peaks (but don't over whip - you don't want
    butter)

    3. Gently fold in puree mixture until thoroughly mixed.

    4. Use a piping bag to pipe unto cupcakes

    5. Optionally, decorate with small berries

    6. Enjoy\!

Happy May\! Soooo here I go procrastinating again. I totally meant to post this a few weeks ago, but here we are.

&nbsp;This recipe was one of the little bitty desserts I made last month for Dylan and Desserts. These little babies are frosted with delicious passion fruit mousse\! I think life is decidedly better with more passion fruit in it, and I think you would feel the same once you try these.&nbsp;

The frosting is actually based on Brazilian passion fruit mousse and it is super easy to make\! You could even just serve this as a standalone dessert, in small ramekins, or mini mousse cups, and decorate as you like - fresh fruit, toasted coconut, etc. BUT\! In this recipe, I've decided to use it as a frosting on teeny lemon cupcakes, and I dare say it worked pretty well\! The combination of sweet and the acidity of the fruit makes these little guys stand out in a crowd.

My one note is that this frosting is not as \*hardy\* or durable as other frostings. These would be best within a couple of days of making, and should be kept in a cool environment lest the frosting lose its shape or \*\*scream face\*\* melts off the cupcake\!

Anywho, hope you enjoy this one, I did ;)&nbsp;
