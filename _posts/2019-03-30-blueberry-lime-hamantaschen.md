    **To prepare the dough:**


    1. &nbsp;mix sugar and flour together in a bowl.&nbsp;

    2. Using a pastry cutter, cut butter into flour and sugar until you get a
    crumbly texture. Alternatively, mix all three in a food processor.

    3. Add rest of ingredients and mix until dough comes together.

    4. Refrigerate for two hours.


    **To prepare jam filling:**


    1. Add blueberries, sugar, and lime to a small pot on medium heat.

    2. Heat mixture for 5 minutes, mixing occasionally, until mostly homogenous
    with some blueberries still in tact.

    3. Dissolve corn starch into a little water.

    4. While stirring mixture, add in corn starch. Heat until mixture thickens.

    5. Take off heat and let cool to room temperature.


    **Assemble:**


    1. Preheat oven to 340F

    2. Prepare cookie sheet covered in parchment paper.

    3. Roll out dough to a little under 1/4 inch.

    4. Cut out circles about 2.5-3 inches in diameter.

    5. Place a teaspoon of filling in middle of each circle - don't overfill!

    6. Fold in sides to make a triangle. Pinch sides&nbsp;**firmly&nbsp;**to
    prevent triangles falling apart and filling spilling out.

    7. Place hamantaschen on cookie sheet

    8. Bake for about 15 minutes - they should not get much color.

    9. Let cool completely, dust with powdered sugar, and enjoy!

So Purim came around a little over a week ago, and this year I tried my hand at making hamantaschen for the first time! There seems to be a few stories around where these little guys came from, but the one I grew up with is that they symbolize the cut off ears of the evil Haman who tried to destroy the Jewish people. And if severed body parts don't get your sweet tooth goingâ€¦ Maybe you can focus on how buttery and delicious these are, instead!

I based this recipe off of Carine Goren's favorite hamantaschen recipe. She uses poppy seeds in hers but I opted for a blueberry lime jam instead. I also swapped the lemon zest in her dough for lime.

Overall I was really happy with the flavor and texture of these, but to be honest my first batch spread out in the oven and created what some may call a "jam volcano". On second try I squeezed the sides extremely firmly, until they basically melded together, and they stayed together pretty well. I might try a recipe with a dough that holds a bit more structure next year and compare. Anywho, the compromised structure didn't stop these from getting devoured!
