    Making the dough:


    1. Mix together all dry ingredients **except&nbsp;**salt in a stand mixer
    bowl with the dough hook attachment.

    2. Add eggs and water, mix on low until wetted, and then increase to medium
    speed for about 3 minutes until dough comes together.

    3. Add salt, and then butter, a few cubes at a time. Continue mixing for 10
    minutes on medium speed until dough is elastic and shiny, pausing to scrape
    down and flour sides to prevent dough sticking.

    4. Place dough in a bowl brushed with oil, cover with plastic wrap, and
    leave in fridge for half a day/overnight.


    ~10 hours later


    1. Brush two loaf pans (~9x5) with oil and line with wax paper

    2. Prepare filling by melting butter and then whisking with Nutella until
    smooth

    3. Divide dough in half. Return one half to fridge.&nbsp;

    4. Roll out the remaining half into a rectangle ~11 x 15 on a floured
    surface.

    5. Spoon and spread filling over the rectangle, taking care to leave about
    an inch border.&nbsp;

    6. Tightly roll the dough&nbsp;**long way**, so that you end up with a roll
    ~15 inch long.&nbsp;

    7. Trim an inch off the ends.

    8. This is the messy bit: cut the roll length wise

    9. Twist the two halves around each other and place in a loaf pan and cover
    with a damp towel

    10. Repeat with the other half of the dough

    11. Let the dough rise in a warm place for 1-1 1/2 hours

    12. Preheat over to 375F

    13. Uncover loaves and bake for about 30 minutes, until a skewer comes out
    clean

    14. In the meantime, prepare your syrup by bringing grapefruit juice and
    sugar to a boil, then let the syrup cool until the cakes are done baking

    15. Once the cakes are done baking, immediately brush with syrup. Make sure
    to completely cover cake with syrup and a bit more - the syrup will infuse
    moisture into the cake

    16. Let the cakes cool down until cool enough to handle, then remove from
    pans to cool completely

    17. Serve and enjoy!

One of my favorite things about visiting Israel (other than seeing my family, duh) is visiting all the bakeries. It is truly a no carb left behind situation. What I think is particularly unique about Israeli baked goods is what would locally be called "yeast cakes", or what is often referred to as Krantz or Babka cakes stateside. I recently got interested in the differences and origins of both, and found [this article](https://food52.com/blog/18792-the-babka-you-ve-seen-everywhere-isn-t-really-babka-after-all){: target="_blank"} illuminating if you too find yourself curious! The gist is babka was originally made with leftover challah dough that got transformed into a somewhat dry and (in today's standards) lackluster dessert. Krantz however also incorporates butter and syrup to make an all around sweeter, shinier, more exciting final product. Since, the lines have been blurred and many people now refer to them interchangeably.Â

This particular recipe is based off of Yotam Ottolenghi's chocolate krantz cake recipe. I recently decided I should let my baking follow my taste buds and take a stab at the famed "yeast cake". I think it was well worth it, and I think you might too!

Take care to notice this recipe requires a bit of planning - it is meant to rest refrigerated for at least half a day, and Ottolenghi suggests letting it rest overnight. I myself changed up the filling and syrup to suit my preferences from the original recipe, and you too can play around with fillings you like - crushed nuts, different types of chocolate, etc.

I hope you enjoy it, I sure did!
